                Summary: Frank Ghery designed the hall from the inside out, focusing on acoustics and the connection between the people and the orchestra. In fact, a practice concert was held during construction to test the acoustics. He believes the clarity of the sounds and relationship between the audience and performer are the most important parts of the halls.

                I feel that this building is incredible and would be magnificent to see in person. It instantly stands out as a unique building designed from the architect’s heart and with the function in mind. It is evident that much of the building was created around presenting both an acoustical and visual experience.

                One thing I observed is how detailed and well thought out the interior of the building is. The interior is extremely spacious and inviting, and extremely well lit despite the full metal exterior. The inside also features numerous curves, arches and mostly natural colors and shapes.

                One important thing I learned from this blog was that despite the donations and purpose of building the concert hall, it is evident it was designed and built for the people and connections between people. Everything from the wooden accents, level stage and audience, and even the imaginative and smooth outline was built to make the hall a central gathering place for people.

                Through this website, I learned that Frank Ghery believes the purpose of architecture is to design something enjoyable and improve someone’s life. He also views architecture as a medium to convey feelings of humanity and comfort. When designing the concert hall, Gehry actively incorporated elements that would make performers and listeners feel comfortable.
